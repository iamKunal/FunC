# Plot FunC++

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamkunal/FunC/master/logo.bmp)

A Function Plotter made using TurboC++ as a class 12 project for CBSE Board. The Project File with Documentation for CBSE is included as PDF.

You can use it by downloading DosBox from : https://www.dosbox.com/
and then running SOFTWARE.EXE under it.

IMG.H file is not mine and is just used to add logo in the file.

doc.txt contains all the valid functions it can handle, view it in tab as 8 spaces. It can also be viewed using the menu in the EXE

I thought of saving feedback online but I couldn't do it since DosBox doesn't support sending even GET data online.


The source for online feedback submission can be found under the OnlineFeedBack Directory in PHP.
